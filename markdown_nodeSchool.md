# Hello World
 Welcome to how-to-markdown!  
   
 ### What is Markdown?  
   
  First things first, let's consider what Markdown actually is.  
   
  Markdown - is a lightweight, easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format  
  for styling all forms of writing around the Internet. Markdown helps to  
  control the display of the document: formatting words as bold or italic,  
  adding images, creating lists and so on.  
   
  Markdown was made by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) in 2004,  
  with significant collaboration from [Aaron  
  Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/).  
   
  Markdown can be written in a basic text editor. It's an easy way to write  
  text that easily translates into HTML. When you write in Markdown, you  
  have to save the document with the .md or .markdown extensions.  
   
  We can use Markdown almost everywhere:  
   
   » StackOverflow uses Markdown for posts and comments.                         
   » GitHub uses Markdown for discussions in issues and pull requests.           
   » Reddit uses Markdown for formatting comments.                               
   » Slack, Gitter and other IM use Markdown for formatting messages.            
   » Jekyll, Octopress, Hexo and other static site tools use Markdown.           
   » GitBook uses Markdown for writing books.                                    
   » Many people prefer to use Markdown for writing their blogs.                 
   » Documentations for many open source project are written in Markdown.        
   » how-to-markdown also uses Markdown for formatting exercises.                
   
  So, knowledge of Markdown is an important skill for modern developers.  
  That's why you have to learn it.  
   
 ### How to get Markdown?  
   
  There is no clearly defined Markdown standard. Markdown is just common  
  rules on how to write readable and formatted text.  
   
  While Markdown is a minimal markup language and is easily read and edited  
  with a normal text editor, there's no need in specially designed editors  
  for writing files in Markdown. However, there are a few editors that  
  preview the files with styles.  
   
  Implementations of Markdown are available for over a dozen programming  
  languages (JavaScript, Ruby, Python, PHP, Perl, etc). In addition, many  
  platforms and frameworks support Markdown out of the box. For example,  
  Markdown plugins exist for every major blogging platform.

  three commands for interacting with this workshopper:
